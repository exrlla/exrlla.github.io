            I looked into the current Illinois Design Consulting website and analyzed its strengths and weaknesses of the website. 
            I also looked into other design consulting websites at other campuses' to see how they are designed and what they do well!

                Many of the design websites we looked at lacked and rather had their own established presence.
                As a goal for the IDC Website, we want to increase the University of Illinois' branding. 
                We want to include the University of Illinois' branding and colors to make the website more recognizable.

              <li class="pb-5">We want to include community efforts to showcase the community in Illinois Design Consulting, and many of the design websites we looked at do 
                this well by providing images, community links, and blogs.

              <li>The three potential audiences IDC has is Students, Clients, and Staff. The competitor websites have different audiences they are reaching. For IDC, we wan't 
                to appeal to all three, and make sure that we include information for all of these audiences
                such as our portfolio, staff/student biographies, and client information.</li>

              <li> I got to learn so much about the design process! Asking the right questions is so important! Knowing to ask WHY is crucial. 
                A user can do anything but WHY did they do it? (Thanks Allison for this one!)  <br/><br/></li>
              <li>This was my first time conducting user interviews, and I learned so much about the user journey as you go through a product! 
                Going from the nav bar, or understanding why a user is going to a certain section of a page is really interesting.<br/><br/></li>
              <li>I got to work on a project team with designers from a variety of backgrounds, and it helped so much getting their feedback!! 
                I felt as if though everytime we gave feedback, I came out with more insights on creating a new version 
              of an interview question or story map, which helped interviews run so much more smoother!  </li>
