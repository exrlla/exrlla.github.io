                  Currently, there is no application that helps college students keep track of their mental health specifically for college students.
                  However, as college students, we can relate to the struggles of keeping track of our mental health and how it can be difficult to do so and its social stigma.
                  Therefore, we have designed an application addressing this problem.</dd>

              Despite mental health apps being present, students rarely adopt a consistent usage of the apps even when they are interested. 
              Due to the stigma and social influence surrounding mental health apps, students that feel as if they are forced to use the app, 
              suggested by health professionals, are less inclined to stick to it after initial use.

          <p class="reg-text-main mt-4 text-gray-500"> 
              We looked at other interactive systems that are similar to our application. We looked at the strengths and weaknesses 
              of each application and how we can improve on them.

            <p class="reg-text-main mt-4 text-gray-500 "> 
              As we develop a prototype and workflows for how our app might look and prioritize the needs of being fast-paced and 
              essentially “click-less”, we have conducted user interviews of college students at UIUC to understand their knowledge 
              of current mental health apps, and their usage of apps connected to their mental health. 
                <br/><br/>
              The following are questions we asked during our user interviews: <br/><br/>
            </p>
            <ul class="a reg-text-main text-gray-500">
              <li>Have you used mental health apps in the Past? Why or why not? </li>
              <li>How much time on average do you spend on Social Media?</li>
              <li>What are your notification settings for apps? Do you change these manually or have the default?</li>
            </ul> 
            <p class="reg-text-main mt-4 text-gray-500"> 
              Through our interviews, we noticed 4 themes that we could use to test out potential features in our 
              application that could be helpful when we create a mock application: Low maintenance, Innovation for mental health, 
              Commfortability, and Relatability.  <br/><br/>
